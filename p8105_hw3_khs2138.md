# Problem 1

## Load dataset

``` r
data("instacart")
insta_df = instacart 
#skimr::skim(insta_df)
#length(unique(insta_df$aisle_id)) # 134 
```

## Describe dataset

**Write a short description of the dataset, noting the size and
structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving
illustrative examples of observations.**

The dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Each row represents a
product with a unique ID and details of its order (day and time), as
well as details of the product. `add_to_cart_order` is a numerical
variable that indicates the order in which items were added to the cart.
`aisle_id` and `department_id` are similar numeric variables that
indicate which aisle and department the product is found in. There are
also product names (e.g., Bulgarian Yogurt, Organic 4% Milk Fat Whole
Milk Cottage Cheese), aisle names (e.g., yogurt, other creams cheeses),
and department names (e.g., dairy eggs, produce).

**How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?** There are 134 aisles, and the most items are ordered from fresh
vegetables and fresh fruits

``` r
ailse_ct = 
  insta_df |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n_obs))
```

**Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.**

``` r
ailse_ct |>
  filter(n_obs > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n_obs)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_obs)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

**Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.**

``` r
insta_df |>
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients","dog food care","packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle, product_name) |>
  summarize(n_obs = n()) |>
  filter(min_rank(desc(n_obs)) < 4) |>
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

 # filter(rank < 4)
```

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).
